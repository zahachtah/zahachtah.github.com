## Inspirational repository for theory on generating human well-being

The process of providing the environment for generating theory that promotes human well-being needs

* Understanding the system/situation
* Aligning the goal
* Enabling options through knowledge and innovation
* Processes of invoking change

To understand complex adaptive systems we must

* Variability
* Interdependence
* Response and agency by situation

Martys conceptual model:

* coupled infrastructure systems
* modules
* feedback control

Think about categories

Main theoretical concepts: variability, interdependence, response and agency, scale, etc

Think about tags

Case systems such as: ecosystems, economy, Brain, social
Methods such as: feedback control, adaptive dynamics, critical transitions, sparse representations, NLTK, game theory
Problem stage: Understanding, goal, enabling, invoking
Sub-concepts such as: distributions of variability, integrated trait-lag

People in the network:

Marty, Van, Marten

## Cool list from Donella Meadows

12) Numbers: Constants and parameters such as subsidies, taxes, and standards 11) Buffers:The sizes of stabilizing stocks relative to their flows
10) Stock-and-Flow Structures: Physical systems and their nodes of intersection 9) Delays: The lengths of time relative to the rates of system changes
8) Balancing Feedback Loops: The strength of the feedbacks relative to the impacts they are trying to correct
7) Reinforcing Feedback Loops: The strength of the gain of driving loops
6) Information Flows:The structure of who does and does not have access to information
5) Rules: Incentives, punishments, constraints
4) Self-Organization: The power to add, change, or evolve system structure
3) Goals:The purpose or function of the system
2) Paradigms: The mindset out of which the system—its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters—arises. 
1) Transcending Paradigms
