## Introduction

The problem of understanding complex adaptive systems under climate change

* System dynamics
* Adaptive change (temperature response)
* Integrative change (lake with phosphate)
* Network changes (food web dynamics and desruption)

## A model of adaptive change


$${dN_i \over dt} = \left( \left( 1 - \int_I{N_i} \right)$$


 e^{-{(T-t_{opt})^2 \over w^2}} - m \right) N_i + I.$$


$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$


## A model of integrative+adaptive change

Add nutrient accumulation to abiotic variable, phosphate release coupled to biomass production, coupled to a community of plankton that has nutrient uptke traits.

## A model of integrative+adaptive+network change

Add invasion/extinction of food web components to web

Add also metacommunity dynamics

## Closing in on r phase

## Closing in on K phase

## CLosing in on Omega phase

## Closing in on alpha phase (reorganization)

Test invasability of food webs in each phase
